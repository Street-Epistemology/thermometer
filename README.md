# Thermometer üå°Ô∏è
Bot for the Street Epistemology Discord live shows.

# Features

These features only work within the _üî¥live-show-text_ channel.

To _use_ there commands below means to type them 

All commands are case-insensitive (can be either lower or uppercase) for the first letter. This was implemented to accommodate for many smartphones autocapitalising the first letter.

## Public features

### `-` handles show claims and questions

Anyone on the server can write claims and questions to be shown on screen by preceeding them with a dash/minus (only work). Editing the message to add the dass/minus after posting does not currently work. Claims/questions that included a dash/minus on first post can be edited for spellcheck and rewording.
